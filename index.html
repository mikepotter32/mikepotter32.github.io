    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
    <p>
        I'm going to take some time and write about CyanogenMod and the great
      developers behind this project. Mainly Steve Kondik.
    </p>
    <p>
        CyanogenMod is developed as FOSS based on the official releases of Android
      by Google. Steve Kondik is the founder of this project. In September of
      2008 enthusiasts found a way to attain root access on the HTC Dream phone.
      Having this root access and the open nature of android in general led to
      the phone’s stock firmware being modified and re-installed.  Eventually
      certain firmware became popular with Steve Kondik’s Cyanogen leading the
      charge. Since Cyanogen is free and open source many developers gravitated
      towards it, within months, the number of devices and features supported by
      CyanogenMod blossomed.
    </p>
    <p>
        Today CyanogenMod has recorded over 12 million active installs on a
      multitude of devices. Although not every device is supported, Cyanogen
      is a nice way to receive updates and some new features of android on older
      phones, where the OEM may have cut off support.
    </p>
    <p>
        Steve Kondik actively contributes too many repositories on GitHub,
      specifically many firmware updates for newer devices, such as the OnePlus
      One, Oppo, etc. Steve has also created many repositories – The CM kernel,
      many Samsung Galaxy kernels, and the cm-updater-manifest.
    </p>
    <p>
        CyanogenMod, I find very interesting, with the attempts from google
      trying to shut Cyanogen down, to the increased popularity of the software.
      It’s a custom ROM with no bloatware, root enabled, it receives updates
      quicker and for the most part offers better performance than most OEM
      roms.
    </p>
    <p>
        Steve’s brand can be seen all over the internet, @Cyanogen. Twitter,
      GitHub, he goes by his real name on Facebook, and google+.
    </p>
    <p>
        On to another topic - Windows 10. How awesome does it look? There’s the
      revamped start menu, the tablet and phone integration, Cortana and many
      other general improvements.
    </p>
    <p>
        The new start menu looks fantastic, taking the metro UI from windows 8
      and integrating it into the desktop model.  It’s a combination of windows
      7 and windows 8. Even the metro apps are being updated to work in window
      panes like everything else in windows.  Integrating the live tiles into
      the start menu makes sense, and improves functionality.
    </p>
    <p>
        Now what I think is one of the best aspects, although I’d really like to
      know the technology that goes into it, is that Windows 10 will be run on
      phones, tablets, laptops, and desktops. Does this mean windows 10 has ARM
      support? They did say that MOST windows 8.1 phones will be getting the
      update to 10. I know intel has some very nice power efficient x64
      processors that go well with tablets, and there are a few ARM 64bit
      processors out there now, Namely Apples A8, Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 610
      and 810 and the NVidia Tegra k1. Microsoft didn’t discuss the details on
      what exactly will be going on behind the scenes so I don’t know how this
      will work. I assume they are going to be dropping support for windows RT
      soon, but from the sound of things they might have just retooled that
      along with windows 8.1 to create the phone version of windows 10. Time
      will tell.
    </p>
    <p>
        Cortana is another interesting feature coming to windows 10. I’m going
      to assume most people are familiar with Siri by now, Cortana is
      basically like a new and improved version of Siri, you can set
      reminders, she answers questions (weather, traffic, sports, etc),
      active listening (phone for now) – This one I find interesting, being
      able to just say Hey Cortana, and then ask a question, or have her set
      an alarm, that’s fantastic. I look forward to using this feature. And
      to see Microsoft’s Flagship phone they will be releasing this
      summer/fall. It will be an interesting year for technology, Apple,
      Google, Samsung, Virtual Reality (Oculus Rift, Microsoft HoloLens, and
      Samsung), Intel’s Skylake processors are due as well. They say its due
      to revolutionize computing, but we’ll be the judge of that.

      Anyways that's it from me.
